# VARIABLES
#### Variable is used to hold a data. In JavaScript we have two types (and one more if we sure that we will not change it till the end) of variables. We can use both of them but of course they have some difference.
##### Difference :
1. let : Local
2. Var : Global - it can be local when it is in function.
3. const : doesn't changes
